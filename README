st - simple terminal (patched)
------------------------------
This is *NOT* a fork of upstream st, it's rebased off of upstream with every
release.

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less. This repository carries
a few patches that are not applied by default upstream. Those patches are:

 * https://st.suckless.org/patches/ligatures/
 * https://st.suckless.org/patches/boxdraw/
 * https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/
 * https://st.suckless.org/patches/vertcenter/
 * https://st.suckless.org/patches/anysize/
 * https://st.suckless.org/patches/clipboard/

The patches are modified as necessary to apply alongside each other or to fix
bugs in the upstream patches.

This repository also carries some local patches to the Xresources patch which
adjust the following properties of the patch:

 * Change default colors
 * Allow terminal name to be configured
 * Allow cursor shape to be configured

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
